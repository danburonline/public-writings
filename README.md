# Public Writings

This repository hosts the content and source code for all my public writings, including papers, essays, and other works. The documents are written in LaTeX using a custom template system that can be found in the `templates` directory. For more details on the template system, please see the [`templates/README.md`](templates/README.md).

Contributions are welcome, as these documents are intended to be continuously updated, even after initial publication.
