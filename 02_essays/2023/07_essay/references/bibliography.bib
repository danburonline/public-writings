  abstract     = {The existence of multiple parallel loops connecting sensorimotor systems to the basal ganglia has given rise to proposals that these nuclei serve as a selection mechanism resolving competitions between the alternative actions available in a given context. A strong test of this hypothesis is to require a computational model of the basal ganglia to generate integrated selection sequences in an autonomous agent, we therefore describe a robot architecture into which such a model is embedded, and require it to control action selection in a robotic task inspired by animal observations. Our results demonstrate effective action selection by the embedded model under a wide range of sensory and motivational conditions. When confronted with multiple, high salience alternatives, the robot also exhibits forms of behavioral disintegration that show similarities to animal behavior in conflict situations. The model is shown to cast light on recent neurobiological findings concerning behavioral switching and sequencing.},

It has long been thought that motor control is achieved through the balanced activity of two parallel and anatomically distinct pathways, acting on the basal ganglia with opposing effects, but these pathways have never been functionally verified. Kravitz et al. have tested this hypothesis directly using optogenetic activation of different populations of mouse striatal neurons, and they both trace functional connectivity and demonstrate opposing effects on motor behaviour. Selective activation of the 'direct' pathway increased locomotion and rescued motor deficits in a parkinsonian model, whereas activation of the 'indirect' pathway suppressed motor behaviour.},

Retinitis pigmentosa is a neurodegenerative eye disease where loss of photoreceptors can lead to complete blindness. In a blind patient, we combined intraocular injection of an adeno-associated viral vector encoding {ChrimsonR} with light stimulation via engineered goggles. The goggles detect local changes in light intensity and project corresponding light pulses onto the retina in real time to activate optogenetically transduced retinal ganglion cells. The patient perceived, located, counted and touched different objects using the vector-treated eye alone while wearing the goggles. During visual perception, multichannel electroencephalographic recordings revealed object-related activity above the visual cortex. The patient could not visually detect any objects before injection with or without the goggles or after injection without the goggles. This is the first reported case of partial functional recovery in a neurodegenerative disease after optogenetic therapy.},

  abstract  = {The dorsal striatum plays a central role in motor and decision programs, such as the selection and execution of particular actions and the evaluation of their outcomes. A standard model has emerged where distinct output pathways encode separate motor-action signals, including selection-evaluation division in the matrix versus patch compartments. We used large-scale cell-type specific calcium imaging during motor and decision behaviors to determine and contrast the activity of individual striatal projection neurons ({SPNs}) belonging to one of the three major output pathways in the dorsomedial striatum – patch Oprm1+ {SPNs} versus the D1+ direct and A2A+ indirect pathway. We found that Oprm1+ {SPNs} were tuned to a number of different behavioral categories, such as to different movements, or to discrete actions and decisions in a two-choice task, and these complex representations were found to the same extent in all three striatal output pathways. The sharp tuning of individual {SPNs} was highly stereotyped over time while performing a specific task, but the tuning profile remapped between different behavioral contexts. In addition to action representations, {SPNs} showed pathway-independent representation of decision-variables such as the trial strategy and the action value. We propose that all three major output pathways in the dorsomedial striatum share a similarly complete representation of the entire action space, including task- and phase-specific signals of action value and choice.},

  abstract     = {When moving, humans must overcome intrinsic (body centered) and extrinsic (target-related) redundancy, requiring decisions when selecting one motor solution among several potential ones. During classical reaching studies the position of a salient target determines where the participant should reach, constraining the associated motor decisions. We aimed at investigating implicit variables guiding action selection when faced with the complexity of human-environment interaction. Subjects had to perform whole body reaching movements towards a uniform surface. We observed little variation in the self-chosen motor strategy across repeated trials while movements were variable across subjects being on a continuum from a pure ‘knee flexion’ associated with a downward center of mass ({CoM}) displacement to an ‘ankle dorsi-flexion’ associated with an upward {CoM} displacement. Two optimality criteria replicated these two strategies: a mix between mechanical energy expenditure and joint smoothness and a minimization of the amount of torques. Our results illustrate the presence of idiosyncratic values guiding posture and movement coordination that can be combined in a flexible manner as a function of context and subject. A first value accounts for the reach efficiency of the movement at the price of selecting possibly unstable postures. The other predicts stable dynamic equilibrium but requires larger energy expenditure and jerk.},

  abstract     = {The flexibility of behavioral control is a testament to the brain's capacity for dynamically resolving uncertainty during goal-directed actions. This ability to select actions and learn from immediate feedback is driven by the dynamics of basal ganglia ({BG}) pathways. A growing body of empirical evidence conflicts with the traditional view that these pathways act as independent levers for facilitating (i.e., direct pathway) or suppressing (i.e., indirect pathway) motor output, suggesting instead that they engage in a dynamic competition during action decisions that computationally captures action uncertainty. Here we discuss the utility of encoding action uncertainty as a dynamic competition between opposing control pathways and provide evidence that this simple mechanism may have powerful implications for bridging neurocomputational theories of decision making and reinforcement learning.},
