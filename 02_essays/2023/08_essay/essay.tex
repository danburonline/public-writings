%   Notes:
%   Developing and marketing laboratory-grown meat, also known as cultured meat or clean meat, requires a deep understanding of the scientific and technological advancements in the field, as well as consumer perceptions and acceptance. Neuroscientific findings can provide valuable insights into consumer behavior and decision-making processes, which can inform the development and marketing strategies for lab-grown meat.

% One key aspect to consider is the motivation behind consumer choices. Research suggests that environmental concerns, animal welfare, and health considerations are important factors that could motivate consumers to purchase lab-grown meat (Circus & Robison, 2019). Lab-grown meat has the potential to address environmental issues associated with traditional meat production, such as greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and water consumption (Tuomisto & Mattos, 2011). By highlighting these environmental benefits, companies can appeal to consumers who are conscious of their ecological footprint and seek sustainable alternatives.

% Additionally, consumer perceptions and attitudes towards lab-grown meat play a crucial role in its acceptance and market success. Public perceptions and reactions to lab-grown meat are still largely unknown and uninvestigated (Verbeke et al., 2015). Therefore, it is important to conduct research to understand consumer preferences, concerns, and barriers to adoption. Studies have shown that lab-grown meat is perceived as less sustainable, more expensive, and higher in calories compared to other meat alternatives (Possidónio et al., 2021). Addressing these perceptions through education and communication can help overcome consumer resistance and increase acceptance.

% Furthermore, sensory and nutritional aspects of lab-grown meat should be considered in its development and marketing. Comparisons between cultured meat and traditional meat have been made in terms of molecular, technological, and sensorial attributes (Fraeye et al., 2020). It is important to ensure that lab-grown meat meets or exceeds the sensory expectations of consumers, such as taste, texture, and appearance. Additionally, nutritional aspects should be highlighted, emphasizing the potential health benefits of lab-grown meat, such as reduced saturated fat content and absence of antibiotics or hormones (Fraeye et al., 2020).

% To successfully develop and market lab-grown meat, it is crucial to address regulatory and safety concerns. Strict hygiene conditions and sterile systems applied to the production of lab-grown meat contribute significantly to improving its safety by minimizing the risk of food-borne pathogens (Sergelidis, 2019). Regulatory acceptance of lab-grown meat is an important factor that can impact its marketability and consumer trust (Roy & Mandal, 2020). Collaborating with regulatory agencies and ensuring compliance with safety standards can help build confidence in the product.

% In conclusion, developing and marketing laboratory-grown meat requires a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates scientific advancements, consumer perceptions, and regulatory considerations. By addressing environmental concerns, highlighting the benefits of lab-grown meat, and ensuring sensory and nutritional quality, companies can position lab-grown meat as a sustainable and viable alternative to traditional meat. Understanding consumer motivations and addressing their concerns through education and communication are essential for increasing acceptance and market success.

% There are several reasons why people may be negative about new things from an evolutionary perspective, but the search results do not provide a direct answer to this question. However, some of the search results discuss attitudes towards new things in different contexts, which may provide some insights into this topic. For example, a study on a new mathematics curriculum in Portugal found that while teachers approved of the new orientations, they complained about the design and implementation of the program

% . Similarly, a study on geriatric nursing homes' staff members found that they lack end-of-life care education and experience poor mental health and burnout

% . These findings suggest that people may be negative about new things if they perceive them as poorly designed or implemented, or if they lack the necessary skills or resources to adapt to them. Another study on positive and negative management challenges identified several "pre-logical biases" that can influence attitudes towards change, such as a preference for order vs. disorder, static vs. dynamic, and continuity vs. discreteness

% . These biases may reflect evolutionary adaptations that helped humans survive in different environments, but they can also lead to resistance to change in certain contexts. Overall, while the search results do not provide a direct answer to the question of why people may be negative about new things from an evolutionary perspective, they suggest that attitudes towards change can be influenced by various factors, such as design, implementation, skills, resources, and biases.
