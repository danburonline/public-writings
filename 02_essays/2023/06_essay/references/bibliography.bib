	abstract = {The burgeoning interest in investigating the first episode of schizophrenia and related disorders provides an opportunity to examine how this approach has assisted our understanding of the heterogeneity of psychopathology of this disorder and the trajectories of its outcome. We present a review of relevant literature on categorical versus dimensional perspectives on psychopathology, with special reference to early signs, its relationship with other patient- and system-related characteristics, and the status and determinants of functional outcome and quality of life. The findings from longitudinal studies of the dimensional psychopathology of first-episode psychosis suggest continuity of some psychopathological dimensions from premorbid through prodromal to post-onset phases of psychosis and some aspects of longer-term course. Short-term functional outcome improves after treatment of the first episode, but longer-term outcome remains relatively poor for a substantial proportion of patients and is associated with preadolescent onset, poor premorbid adjustment, poor cognitive functioning, cerebral asymmetry, and negative symptoms during prodromal and post-onset phases. Poor quality of life is related to residual psychopathology, long delays in treatment, and poor premorbid adjustment. The potential effects of improved treatment and/or early intervention on functional outcome and quality of life have not been adequately examined, nor have the interrelationships between predictors and the underlying processes involved in determining variations in outcome. Studies of functional outcome still lack the rigor of operational definitions, choice of specific instruments for measurement, and use of large enough samples to generate meaningful results.},

	abstract = {Though numerous studies have implicated structural abnormalities in chronically depressive patients, relatively little attention has been paid to the brain alterations in patients experiencing first episode depression (FED). The investigation of FED is important for elucidating the core pathophysiology of this disease independent of other potentially confounding factors. The present study was to provide a quantitative voxelwise meta-analysis of gray matter (GM) changes in FED using effect-size signed differential mapping (ES-SDM). The pooled meta-analysis revealed GM reductions in the right supplementary motor area, left insula, and right middle temporal gyrus in FED patients compared with the healthy controls. No GM volume increases were found. The meta-regression analyses showed that studies including patients with higher HDRS scores were significantly more likely to present reduced GM volumes in the right amygdala. This meta-analysis indicates that FED patients have significantly and robustly reduced gray matter mainly associated with emotion regulation and sensorimotor areas alterations may be specific changes in early stage of this disease.},
