	abstract = {The burgeoning interest in investigating the first episode of schizophrenia and related disorders provides an opportunity to examine how this approach has assisted our understanding of the heterogeneity of psychopathology of this disorder and the trajectories of its outcome. We present a review of relevant literature on categorical versus dimensional perspectives on psychopathology, with special reference to early signs, its relationship with other patient- and system-related characteristics, and the status and determinants of functional outcome and quality of life. The findings from longitudinal studies of the dimensional psychopathology of first-episode psychosis suggest continuity of some psychopathological dimensions from premorbid through prodromal to post-onset phases of psychosis and some aspects of longer-term course. Short-term functional outcome improves after treatment of the first episode, but longer-term outcome remains relatively poor for a substantial proportion of patients and is associated with preadolescent onset, poor premorbid adjustment, poor cognitive functioning, cerebral asymmetry, and negative symptoms during prodromal and post-onset phases. Poor quality of life is related to residual psychopathology, long delays in treatment, and poor premorbid adjustment. The potential effects of improved treatment and/or early intervention on functional outcome and quality of life have not been adequately examined, nor have the interrelationships between predictors and the underlying processes involved in determining variations in outcome. Studies of functional outcome still lack the rigor of operational definitions, choice of specific instruments for measurement, and use of large enough samples to generate meaningful results.},

The investigation of FED is important for elucidating the core pathophysiology of this disease independent of other potentially confounding factors. The present study was to provide a quantitative voxelwise meta-analysis of gray matter (GM) changes in FED using effect-size signed differential mapping (ES-SDM). The pooled meta-analysis revealed GM reductions in the right supplementary motor area, left insula, and right middle temporal gyrus in FED patients compared with the healthy controls. No GM volume increases were found. The meta-regression analyses showed that studies including patients with higher HDRS scores were significantly more likely to present reduced GM volumes in the right amygdala. This meta-analysis indicates that FED patients have significantly and robustly reduced gray matter mainly associated with emotion regulation and sensorimotor areas alterations may be specific changes in early stage of this disease.},

	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD003267.pub2},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Communication problems in health care may arise as a result of healthcare providers focusing on diseases and their management, rather than people, their lives and their health problems. Patient-centred approaches to care delivery in the patient encounter are increasingly advocated by consumers and clinicians and incorporated into training for healthcare providers. However, the impact of these interventions directly on clinical encounters and indirectly on patient satisfaction, healthcare behaviour and health status has not been adequately evaluated.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions for healthcare providers that aim to promote patient-centred care (PCC) approaches in clinical consultations.
SEARCH METHODS: For this update, we searched: MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), and CINAHL (EbscoHOST) from January 2000 to June 2010. The earlier version of this review searched MEDLINE (1966 to December 1999), EMBASE (1985 to December 1999), PsycLIT (1987 to December 1999), CINAHL (1982 to December 1999) and HEALTH STAR (1975 to December 1999). We searched the bibliographies of studies assessed for inclusion and contacted study authors to identify other relevant studies. Any study authors who were contacted for further information on their studies were also asked if they were aware of any other published or ongoing studies that would meet our inclusion criteria.
SELECTION CRITERIA: In the original review, study designs included randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time series studies of interventions for healthcare providers that promote patient-centred care in clinical consultations. In the present update, we were able to limit the studies to randomized controlled trials, thus limiting the likelihood of sampling error. This is especially important because the providers who volunteer for studies of PCC methods are likely to be different from the general population of providers. Patient-centred care was defined as a philosophy of care that encourages: (a) shared control of the consultation, decisions about interventions or management of the health problems with the patient, and/or (b) a focus in the consultation on the patient as a whole person who has individual preferences situated within social contexts (in contrast to a focus in the consultation on a body part or disease). Within our definition, shared treatment decision-making was a sufficient indicator of PCC. The participants were healthcare providers, including those in training.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We classified interventions by whether they focused only on training providers or on training providers and patients, with and without condition-specific educational materials. We grouped outcome data from the studies to evaluate both direct effects on patient encounters (consultation process variables) and effects on patient outcomes (satisfaction, healthcare behaviour change, health status). We pooled results of RCTs using standardized mean difference (SMD) and relative risks (RR) applying aÂ fixed-effect model.
MAIN RESULTS: Forty-three randomized trials met the inclusion criteria, of which 29 are new in this update. In most of the studies, training interventions were directed at primary care physicians (general practitioners, internists, paediatricians or family doctors) or nurses practising in community or hospital outpatient settings. Some studies trained specialists. Patients were predominantly adults with general medical problems, though two studies included children with asthma. Descriptive and pooled analyses showed generally positive effects on consultation processes on a range of measures relating to clarifying patients' concerns and beliefs; communicating about treatment options; levels of empathy; and patients' perception of providers' attentiveness to them and their concerns as well as their diseases. A new finding for this update is that short-term training (less than 10 hours) is as successful as longer training.The analyses showed mixed results on satisfaction, behaviour and health status. Studies using complex interventions that focused on providers and patients with condition-specific materials generally showed benefit in health behaviour and satisfaction, as well as consultation processes, with mixed effects on health status. Pooled analysis of the fewer than half of included studies with adequate data suggests moderate beneficial effects from interventions on the consultation process; and mixed effects on behaviour and patient satisfaction, with small positive effects on health status. Risk of bias varied across studies. Studies that focused only on provider behaviour frequently did not collect data on patient outcomes, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn about the relative effect of intervention focus on providers compared with providers and patients.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to promote patient-centred care within clinical consultations are effective across studies in transferring patient-centred skills to providers. However the effects on patient satisfaction, health behaviour and health status are mixed. There is some indication that complex interventions directed at providers and patients that include condition-specific educational materials have beneficial effects on health behaviour and health status, outcomes not assessed in studies reviewed previously. The latter conclusion is tentative at this time and requires more data. The heterogeneity of outcomes, and the use of single item consultation and health behaviour measures limit the strength of the conclusions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) includes a comprehensive assessment of incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 354 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017. Previous GBD studies have shown how the decline of mortality rates from 1990 to 2016 has led to an increase in life expectancy, an ageing global population, and an expansion of the non-fatal burden of disease and injury. These studies have also shown how a substantial portion of the world's population experiences non-fatal health loss with considerable heterogeneity among different causes, locations, ages, and sexes. Ongoing objectives of the GBD study include increasing the level of estimation detail, improving analytical strategies, and increasing the amount of high-quality data.
METHODS: We estimated incidence and prevalence for 354 diseases and injuries and 3484 sequelae. We used an updated and extensive body of literature studies, survey data, surveillance data, inpatient admission records, outpatient visit records, and health insurance claims, and additionally used results from cause of death models to inform estimates using a total of 68â781 data sources. Newly available clinical data from India, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Nepal, China, Brazil, Norway, and Italy were incorporated, as well as updated claims data from the USA and new claims data from Taiwan (province of China) and Singapore. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between rates of incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death for each condition. YLDs were estimated as the product of a prevalence estimate and a disability weight for health states of each mutually exclusive sequela, adjusted for comorbidity. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary development indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. Additionally, we calculated differences between male and female YLDs to identify divergent trends across sexes. GBD 2017 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting.
FINDINGS: Globally, for females, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and haemoglobinopathies and haemolytic anaemias in both 1990 and 2017. For males, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and tuberculosis including latent tuberculosis infection in both 1990 and 2017. In terms of YLDs, low back pain, headache disorders, and dietary iron deficiency were the leading Level 3 causes of YLD counts in 1990, whereas low back pain, headache disorders, and depressive disorders were the leading causes in 2017 for both sexes combined. All-cause age-standardised YLD rates decreased by 3Â·9\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 3Â·1-4Â·6) from 1990 to 2017; however, the all-age YLD rate increased by 7Â·2\% (6Â·0-8Â·4) while the total sum of global YLDs increased from 562 million (421-723) to 853 million (642-1100). The increases for males and females were similar, with increases in all-age YLD rates of 7Â·9\% (6Â·6-9Â·2) for males and 6Â·5\% (5Â·4-7Â·7) for females. We found significant differences between males and females in terms of age-standardised prevalence estimates for multiple causes. The causes with the greatest relative differences between sexes in 2017 included substance use disorders (3018 cases [95\% UI 2782-3252] per 100â000 in males vs s1400 [1279-1524] per 100â000 in females), transport injuries (3322 [3082-3583] vs 2336 [2154-2535]), and self-harm and interpersonal violence (3265 [2943-3630] vs 5643 [5057-6302]).
INTERPRETATION: Global all-cause age-standardised YLD rates have improved only slightly over a period spanning nearly three decades. However, the magnitude of the non-fatal disease burden has expanded globally, with increasing numbers of people who have a wide spectrum of conditions. A subset of conditions has remained globally pervasive since 1990, whereas other conditions have displayed more dynamic trends, with different ages, sexes, and geographies across the globe experiencing varying burdens and trends of health loss. This study emphasises how global improvements in premature mortality for select conditions have led to older populations with complex and potentially expensive diseases, yet also highlights global achievements in certain domains of disease and injury.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Fulfilling patient expectations is central to defining a good quality of life (QoL) in health. The WHOQOL-BREF was developed using novel, person-centred methods and is a generic patient-reported outcomes measure (PROM). However, without robust psychometric performance, PROMs cannot be relied upon to assess individuals. This study investigated the WHOQOL-BREF (UK), with this use in mind.
DESIGN: Cross sectional with nested repeated measures.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven disease groups or health conditions and healthy people were recruited at 38 UK sites, in a wide range of settings (n = 4628).
INTERVENTIONS: 'Treatment as usual'; new and alternative interventions.
OUTCOME MEASURES: WHOQOL-BREF (UK); SF-36.
RESULTS: Respondent burden was low, as acceptability and feasibility were high. Internal consistency was excellent (0.92) and test-retest reliability good. Distinctive QoL profiles were found for diverse conditions. Musculoskeletal, psychiatric and cardiovascular patients reported the poorest QoL and also improved most during treatment. Overall, QoL was good, and best for healthy groups, supporting discriminant validity. Compared with the SF-36, WHOQOL physical and psychological domains showed good concurrent validity, although social was weak. Small or moderate effect sizes confirmed responsiveness to change in specified domains for certain conditions and interventions. Age had a small impact on reporting QoL.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The WHOQOL-BREF is found to be a high quality patient-centred generic tool suited to individual assessment in clinics, for research, and audit.},
