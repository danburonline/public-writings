  \section{Introduction}
  \label{sec:introduction}

  The intricate relationship between attention and consciousness has long been a topic of discussion and inquiry in the fields of cognitive neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy. Attention, broadly defined as the cognitive process that allows us to concentrate on specific aspects of our environment while filtering out others, is vital to our ability to make sense of the world. It encompasses the selective focus on specific stimuli, the management of cognitive resources, and the guiding of our thoughts and actions based on our goals and interests. On the other hand, conscious awareness refers to the personal experience of recognising and examining our emotions, thoughts, and sensations.

  The pivotal question in studying these cognitive processes is whether attention is necessary for conscious awareness. In simple terms, can we be aware of our surroundings without explicitly directing our attention towards them?

  This essay evaluates the evidence supporting the assertion that attention is essential for conscious awareness. The following sections will utilise various empirical studies and theoretical perspectives to explore the interdependence between attention and conscious awareness, delving into how these cognitive processes may be interconnected. Furthermore, this essay will contemplate alternative perspectives that challenge the indispensability of attention for conscious awareness, incorporating the philosophical implications of Libet’s delay. Ultimately, the author strives to deliver a thorough overview of the intricate relationship between attention and consciousness.

  \section{Definitions and Interplay}
  \label{sec:background}

  \subsection{Consciousness}
  \label{sec:consciousness}

  Consciousness is a multifaceted phenomenon that plays a vital role in cognitive processes. However, defining its types can be challenging due to the need for a universally accepted classification. The list presented in \autoref{tab:overview-consciousness} provides an overview of various types of consciousness but is not exhaustive, as different typologies have been proposed.

  Phenomenal consciousness focuses on qualitative experiences, whereas access consciousness is concerned with information availability for cognitive processing \citep{aru_phenomenal_2013,block_two_2005}. Self-consciousness, which refers to the awareness of one’s existence, can be exemplified by the mirror test in animals, as shown in \autoref{fig:mirror-test}. In this test, a marked monkey recognising itself in a mirror indicates self-awareness \citep{chang_mirror-induced_2015}.

    \label{fig:mirror-test}
  \end{figure}

  Higher-order consciousness involves the awareness of being aware \citep{carruthers_higher-order_2020}, while global workspace consciousness represents the integration of information from various sources to tackle complex tasks \citep{baars_essential_1997}. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of these diverse forms of consciousness and other proposed classifications is essential for exploring the relationship between attention and conscious awareness.

  \subsection{Attention}
  \label{sec:attention}

  Attention is a core cognitive process that enables us to focus selectively on specific aspects of our environment while filtering out irrelevant stimuli. There are various types of attention with selective \citep{koivisto_relationship_2009} and divided attention \citep{mckanna_divided_2009} being two primary examples, as shown in \autoref{tab:overview-attention}.

  In the preceding section, we explored different forms of consciousness, such as phenomenal and access consciousness. Now, we will apply those concepts to deepen our understanding of specific types of attention. Consider selective attention, which can be illustrated by the 'cocktail party effect', as originally published in the landmark paper from \cite{cherry_experiments_1953}, where people focus on a person’s voice in a crowded room while ignoring other conversations. This raises the question of the extent to which unattended information is processed within the scope of our conscious awareness.

  Conversely, divided attention allows simultaneous focus on multiple stimuli, like cooking while listening to a podcast. Research, like \cite{rodrigue_spatio-temporal_2015}, confirms successful dual-task performance under certain conditions.

  \subsection{Libet’s Delay}
  \label{sec:libet}

  In the previous section, the author introduced the concept of various forms of consciousness and hinted at the potential role attention could play in shaping our conscious experiences. A critical aspect of understanding the relationship between attention and consciousness is illustrated through Libet’s delay. In Libet’s original study, participants were asked to voluntarily move their fingers or hands, while carefully noting the moment they became aware of their intention to move. Notably, Libet found that brain activity reflecting the decision to move actually preceded the conscious awareness of the decision by several hundred milliseconds, a phenomenon referred to as 'Libet's delay' \citep{libet_time_1983}. As depicted in \autoref{fig:libet-diagram}, this delay has profound implications for our understanding of consciousness and its relationship to attention.

  \begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/libet.png}
    \caption[This diagram visually represents the critical findings of \cite{libet_time_1983} in terms of the discrepancy between the onset of the readiness potential (a measure of brain activity) and the reported time of conscious awareness of an intention to act \citep{schurger_accumulator_2012}.]{This diagram visually represents the critical findings of \cite{libet_time_1983} in terms of the discrepancy between the onset of the readiness potential (a measure of brain activity) and the reported time of conscious awareness of an intention to act \citep{schurger_accumulator_2012}.}
    \label{fig:libet-diagram}
  \end{figure}

  Libet's findings suggest the intriguing, though contentious, possibility that our subjective experience may not always correspond precisely with underlying neural processes. This introduces complex questions about the role of attention in shaping conscious experiences and adds a temporal dimension to the relationship between attention and consciousness \citep{dijksterhuis_goals_2010}. In integrating the concept of Libet's delay into our understanding of selective and divided attention, we introduce an additional layer of complexity into the underlying mechanisms of conscious awareness. Specifically, the delay's potential influence on conscious awareness during these attentional states is worth considering. For instance, in the context of selective attention, where one focuses on a specific stimulus while ignoring others, Libet's delay might mean that the decision to focus on a particular stimulus occurs before one becomes consciously aware of making such a decision. Similarly, for divided attention, where one is simultaneously processing multiple stimuli, the delay could imply that decisions about where to allocate attention are made at a neural level before reaching conscious awareness. These considerations underscore the temporal intricacies of the attention-consciousness relationship and highlight the need for further exploration.

  The influence of Libet’s delay on different forms of consciousness, such as phenomenal and access consciousness, warrants careful consideration. The temporal discrepancy might differentially affect the relationship between attention and phenomenal consciousness compared to its relationship with access consciousness. Phenomenal consciousness could involve temporally separated subjective experiences, whereas access consciousness might be less affected by the delay, given that information processing can occur independently of subjective experience \citep{dijksterhuis_goals_2010, kozuch_gorillas_2018}.

  \section{Attention’s Role in Conscious Awareness}
  \label{sec:evidence}

  \subsection{Empirical studies}
  \label{sec:empirical}

  Several empirical studies provide evidence for the link between attention and conscious awareness. One such study, conducted by \cite{cohen_attentional_2012}, investigated the attentional requirements of consciousness by manipulating the allocation of attention in a visual search task. Participants were less likely to report conscious awareness of a stimulus when attention was shifted away from it, as shown in \autoref{fig:cohen-attention}, suggesting that attention is a crucial factor in conscious perception.

  \begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/attention.png}
    \caption[Explaining the link between attention and consciousness. According to the model, attention is necessary for information to become consciously aware, but not all attended stimuli will be perceived. Stimuli that are attended to but not perceived can still have measurable effects on behaviour and brain activity. Additionally, stimuli that are not attended to can still cause some neural activity, but the effects will be weaker.]{Explaining the link between attention and consciousness.

Stimuli that are attended to but not perceived can still have measurable effects on behaviour and brain activity. Additionally, stimuli that are not attended to can still cause some neural activity, but the effects will be weaker \citep{cohen_attentional_2012}.}
    \label{fig:cohen-attention}
  \end{figure}

  Similarly, \cite{kentridge_spatial_2004} explored the role of attention in blindsight, a neurological condition in which individuals with damage to the primary visual cortex can respond to visual stimuli without conscious awareness. In their study, the authors demonstrated that when spatial attention was directed towards a stimulus, participants with blindsight exhibited faster response times, despite a lack of conscious awareness. This finding supports the idea that attention can influence unconscious processing and modulate conscious awareness.

  Another study by \cite{sumner_attentional_2006} investigated the role of attention in sensorimotor processes in the absence of perceptual awareness. The authors employed a visual masking paradigm to render stimuli imperceptible and found that attention could still modulate participants’ motor responses to the masked stimuli. This result implies that attention can modulate cognitive processes even when conscious awareness is absent, further highlighting the intricate relationship between attention and conscious awareness.

  \subsection{Theoretical perspectives}
  \label{sec:theoretical}

  Various theoretical perspectives also support the notion that attention is necessary for conscious awareness. \citeauthor{baars_essential_1997}’s \citeyearpar{baars_essential_1997} Global Workspace Theory positions that consciousness arises when information becomes globally available within the brain, and attention plays a crucial role in selecting and broadcasting this information.

  According to this theory, attention acts as a gatekeeper determining which information enters the global workspace and subsequently becomes part of our conscious experience.

  \cite{de_brigard_role_2012} proposed an attentional relevance theory, suggesting that attention is necessary for the conscious recollection of past events. According to this theory, attention enhances the encoding and retrieval of memories by prioritising information relevant to our goals and interests. This perspective emphasises the role of attention in shaping the content of our conscious experiences, particularly in the domain of memory.

  Finally, \cite{dijksterhuis_goals_2010} put forth the idea that attention plays a crucial role in goal-directed behaviour. Goal-directed behaviour refers to actions we undertake to achieve specific outcomes, and is typically thought to involve conscious awareness. For example, when we form a goal to make a cup of coffee, we need to consciously recall the steps involved, selectively attend to relevant stimuli (like the coffee pot and coffee grounds), and ignore irrelevant distractions. In this sense, attention is seen as a mechanism that activates and maintains cognitive representations of goals, enabling us to consciously pursue and achieve desired outcomes. This perspective underscores the crucial role of attention in bridging the gap between our conscious intentions and actions, further reinforcing the necessity of attention for conscious awareness.


  \subsection{Alternative viewpoints and evidence}
  \label{sec:alternative}

  While several studies support the necessity of attention for conscious awareness, others challenge this notion. \cite{aru_phenomenal_2013} examined whether phenomenal awareness could emerge without attention using a visual paradigm in which participants reported their conscious experience of stimuli under various attentional manipulations. The authors found evidence for conscious perception even when attention was directed away from the target stimulus. However, it's worth noting that this doesn't necessarily mean attention is not involved at all. As the feedback suggests, it's possible that participants might still be employing some form of divided attention on the target stimulus, adding another layer of complexity to the interpretation of these results. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that attention may not be strictly necessary for conscious awareness, at least under certain conditions.

  \cite{kentridge_attended_2008} also questioned the sufficiency of attention for visual awareness, examining the interplay between attention and awareness in a patient with visual form agnosia, a condition characterised by the inability to recognise objects despite preserved low-level vision. The authors found that the patient could allocate attention to a stimulus without reporting conscious awareness of its shape or orientation, indicating that attention may be necessary but insufficient for visual awareness.

  Furthermore, \cite{kozuch_gorillas_2018} critically reevaluated the evidence that attention is necessary for consciousness, challenging the conclusions of several well-known studies, including the influential work by \cite{cohen_attentional_2012}. \citeauthor*{kozuch_gorillas_2018} argued that many studies supporting the necessity of attention for consciousness were methodologically flawed or misinterpreted. For instance, some studies may have conflated attention with other cognitive processes or used experimental designs that didn't sufficiently control for the potential influence of other factors. Other studies may have made interpretative leaps that aren't fully justified by their data, overemphasizing the role of attention in consciousness. These criticisms suggest that the attention-consciousness relationship is still open to debate.


  Several theoretical perspectives and philosophical ideas propose alternative viewpoints on the attention-consciousness relationship. \cite{montemayor_types_2021} posited that consciousness encompasses multiple types, each with distinct neural correlates and functional roles. This perspective challenges the idea of a unified attention-consciousness relationship, suggesting that attention may differentially influence various types of consciousness.

  \cite{noah_recent_2020} presented a comprehensive review of recent evidence concerning the attention-consciousness relationship, concluding that while attention is necessary for conscious perception, it alone is insufficient for a complete understanding of conscious awareness. They argued that additional factors, such as the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes, contribute to conscious awareness. This viewpoint highlights the complexity of the attention-consciousness relationship and encourages further exploration of the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms.



  \section{Conclusion}
  \label{sec:conclusion}

  In this essay, the author critically evaluated the statement “attention is necessary for conscious awareness”, drawing upon diverse empirical and theoretical evidence. The essay began by defining the key concepts of consciousness and attention and highlighting their roles in cognitive phenomena. Additionally, it explored Libet’s delay and its potential implications for understanding the attention-consciousness relationship.

  Next, the author presented empirical studies supporting the necessity of attention for conscious awareness, demonstrating attention’s crucial role in shaping and modulating our conscious experience. Yet, while attention appears to be a necessary component of consciousness, it may not be sufficient on its own to give rise to conscious awareness. Other factors, such as the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes, likely contribute to consciousness as well.

  Alternative viewpoints and evidence that challenge the absolute necessity of attention for conscious awareness were also considered. The essay discussed studies offering alternative interpretations of the attention-consciousness relationship and contemporary theoretical perspectives that propose diverse and nuanced views on this relationship, such as those by \cite{montemayor_types_2021} and \cite{noah_recent_2020}.

  In conclusion, the relationship between attention and conscious awareness is complex and multifaceted, with attention appearing necessary but likely insufficient for full conscious awareness. Libet’s delay adds another layer of complexity. By examining diverse perspectives, we can enhance our understanding of the interplay between attention and consciousness while appreciating the dynamic nature of human cognition.
