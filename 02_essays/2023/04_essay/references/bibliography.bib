  abstract  = {Learning to recognize and filter familiar, irrelevant sensory stimuli eases the computational burden on the cerebral cortex. Inhibition is a candidate mechanism in this filtration process, and oscillations in the cortical local field potential (LFP) serve as markers of the engagement of different inhibitory neurons. We show here that LFP oscillatory activity in visual cortex is profoundly altered as male and female mice learn to recognize an oriented grating stimulus—low-frequency (∼15 Hz peak) power sharply increases, whereas high-frequency (∼65 Hz peak) power decreases. These changes report recognition of the familiar pattern as they disappear when the stimulus is rotated to a novel orientation. Two-photon imaging of neuronal activity reveals that parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons disengage with familiar stimuli and reactivate to novelty, whereas somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons show opposing activity patterns. We propose a model in which the balance of two interacting interneuron circuits shifts as novel stimuli become familiar.
               SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Habituation, familiarity, and novelty detection are fundamental cognitive processes that enable organisms to adaptively filter meaningless stimuli and focus attention on potentially important elements of their environment. We have shown that this process can be studied fruitfully in the mouse primary visual cortex by using simple grating stimuli for which novelty and familiarity are defined by orientation and by measuring stimulus-evoked and continuous local field potentials. Altered event-related and spontaneous potentials, and deficient habituation, are well-documented features of several neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders. The paradigm described here will be valuable to interrogate the origins of these signals and the meaning of their disruption more deeply.},

  abstract   = {Background
                Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a debilitating illness associated with considerable impairment of quality of life and substantial costs to health care systems. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established surgical treatment option for some patients with advanced PD. The EARLYSTIM trial has recently demonstrated its clinical benefit also in patients with early motor complications. We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of DBS, compared to best medical therapy (BMT), among PD patients with early onset of motor complications, from a United Kingdom (UK) payer perspective.
                
                Methods
                We developed a Markov model to represent the progression of PD as rated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) over time in patients with early PD. Evidence sources were a systematic review of clinical evidence; data from the EARLYSTIM study; and a UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) dataset including DBS patients. A mapping algorithm was developed to generate utility values based on UPDRS data for each intervention. The cost-effectiveness was expressed as the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to explore the effect of parameter uncertainty.
                
                Results
                Over a 15-year time horizon, DBS was predicted to lead to additional mean cost per patient of £26,799 compared with BMT (£73,077/patient versus £46,278/patient) and an additional mean 1.35 QALYs (6.69 QALYs versus 5.35 QALYs), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £19,887 per QALY gained with a 99\% probability of DBS being cost-effective at a threshold of £30,000/QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses suggested that the results were not significantly impacted by plausible changes in the input parameter values.
                
                Conclusion
                These results indicate that DBS is a cost-effective intervention in PD patients with early motor complications when compared with existing interventions, offering additional health benefits at acceptable incremental cost. This supports the extended use of DBS among patients with early onset of motor complications.},

  abstract   = {Parkinson's disease is a common, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 3\% of those older than 75 years of age. Clinically, Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with resting tremor, postural instability, rigidity, bradykinesia, and a good response to levodopa therapy. Over the last 15 years, numerous studies have confirmed that genetic factors contribute to the complex pathogenesis of PD. Highly penetrant mutations producing rare, monogenic forms of the disease have been discovered in singular genes such as SNCA, Parkin, DJ-1, PINK 1, LRRK2, and VPS35. Unique variants with incomplete penetrance in LRRK2 and GBA have been shown to be strong risk factors for PD in certain populations. Additionally, over 20 common variants with small effect sizes are now recognized to modulate the risk for PD. Investigating Mendelian forms of PD has provided precious insight into the pathophysiology that underlies the more common idiopathic form of disease; however, no treatment methodologies have developed. Furthermore, for identified common risk alleles, the functional basis underlying risk principally remains unknown. The challenge over the next decade will be to strengthen the findings delivered through genetic discovery by assessing the direct, biological consequences of risk variants in tandem with additional high-content, integrated datasets. This review discusses monogenic risk factors and mechanisms of Mendelian inheritance of Parkinson disease. Highly penetrant mutations in SNCA, Parkin, DJ-1, PINK 1, LRRK2 and VPS35 produce rare, monogenic forms of the disease, while unique variants within LRRK2 and GBA show incomplete penetrance and are strong risk factors for PD. Additionally, over 20 common variants with small effect sizes modulate disease risk. The challenge over the next decade is to strengthen genetic findings by assessing direct, biological consequences of risk variants in tandem with high-content, integrated datasets.

  abstract   = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) was first described a little more than 100 years ago. It is the most common cause of dementia with an estimated prevalence of 30 million people worldwide, a number that is expected to quadruple in 40 years. There currently is no effective treatment that delays the onset or slows the progression of AD. However, major scientific advances in the areas of genetics, biochemistry, cell biology, and neuroscience over the past 25 years have changed the way we think about AD. This review discusses some of the challenges to translating these basic molecular and cellular discoveries into clinical therapies. Current information suggests that if the disease is detected before the onset of overt symptoms, it is possible that treatments based on knowledge of underlying pathogenesis can and will be effective.},

  abstract = {Alcohol is one of the most widely misused substances in the world. Alcohol consumption by pregnant women often results in an array of fetal developmental abnormalities, but the damage to the fetus by alcohol remains poorly understood. The limited knowledge regarding the molecular targets of alcohol in the developing fetus constitutes one of the major obstacles in developing effective pharmacological interventions that could prevent fetal damage after alcohol consumption by pregnant women. The fetal cerebral artery is emerging as an important mediator of fetal cerebral damage by maternal alcohol drinking. In the present work, we conduct proteomics analysis of cerebral (basilar) artery lysates of near-term fetal baboons to search for protein targets of fetal alcohol exposure. Our study demonstrates that 3 episodes of binge alcohol exposure during the second trimester-equivalent of human pregnancy are sufficient to render profound changes in fetal cerebral artery proteome. These changes persisted, as they were detected in near-term fetuses. In particular, the relative abundance of 238 proteins differed significantly between control and alcohol-exposed fetuses. Enrichment analysis pointed at the group of metabolic activity proteins as a major class targeted by alcohol. Western blotting confirmed upregulation of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 6 family member A1 (ALDH6A1) in cerebral artery lysates from alcohol-exposed fetuses. This upregulation translated to greater ALDH activity of cerebral artery lysate of near-term fetuses following prenatal alcohol exposure when compared with controls.},
