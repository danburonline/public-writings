## Title

Adaptive Neurological Development in hiPSC-derived Brain Organoids through Interactive Game Worlds

## Abstract

This research proposal outlines a novel approach to studying the neurodevelopmental capabilities of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived brain organoids through interaction with progressively complex game worlds. By subjecting these organoids to environments with escalating levels of complexity and interaction rules, from simple navigation to social dynamics, we aim to observe the emergent adaptive behaviours and neurodevelopmental changes over weeks to months of continuous interaction. This project aims to use advanced neurostimulation and monitoring technologies to investigate the capacity of brain organoids to serve as models for comprehending the neural foundations of memory, learning, and complex behaviour. Additionally, the project will explore the potential of using biological neurons for wetware computing.

## Introduction

Recent advancements in stem cell technology have enabled the development of hiPSC-derived brain organoids, offering outstanding models for studying human brain development and disease. Interactive environments like game worlds have been proposed as innovative platforms for examining complex neural dynamics and learning processes. This research seeks to bridge these domains by introducing brain organoids to a series of game worlds with increasing complexity, exploring their capacity for neural adaptation and learning.

## Objectives

- To develop four distinct game worlds with escalating complexity and interactive rules tailored for engagement with hiPSC-derived brain organoids.
- To observe and analyse the long-term neurodevelopmental adaptations of brain organoids in response to these interactive environments.
- To compare the neurodevelopmental outcomes across organoids exposed to different levels of environmental complexity, focusing on changes in spike patterns and other neurofunctional markers.

## Methodology

### Design of Game Worlds

Four game worlds will be designed, ranging from simple 2D navigation tasks to complex environments involving social interactions and competitive dynamics. Each world will have a defined "success formula," allowing for quantitative organoid performance and adaptation assessment.
Brain Organoid Preparation and Maintenance
Utilising established protocols for hiPSC culture and differentiation, brain organoids will be grown and maintained in conditions optimised for long-term development and interaction with the game environments.

### Interface between Organoids and Game Worlds

A sophisticated interface involving 16-channel electrode arrays and neurotransmitter uncaging mechanisms will enable two-way communication between the brain organoids and the digital game worlds, facilitating real-time interaction and stimulation.

### Data Collection and Analysis

Continuous monitoring of organoid activity will be conducted through electrophysiological recordings, focusing on identifying and analysing emergent patterns of spikes and other markers of neurodevelopment.

## Expected Outcomes

We anticipate that brain organoids will exhibit distinct patterns of neural activity and development in response to the complexity and demands of the interactive environments. These findings could reveal fundamental insights into the neural mechanisms underlying learning and adaptation.

## Significance

This research has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of human brain development, offering a novel perspective on the capacity for neural adaptation to environmental stimuli. Moreover, it could open new avenues for developing AI algorithms inspired by biological learning processes and contribute to neurorehabilitation by providing innovative models for studying brain plasticity and recovery.
