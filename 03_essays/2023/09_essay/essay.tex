  \section{Introduction}
  \label{sec:introduction}

  Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as a tough challenge in neurodegenerative research, characterised by its insidious onset and progressive cognitive decline. This essay explores the use of advanced neuroimaging to uncover changes in AD. The main focus is on the correlation between changes and neuropathological markers of Alzheimer's disease, specifically beta-amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles.

  The aim is to critically assess the capabilities and limitations of various neuroimaging modalities, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in detecting these biomarkers. This investigation is grounded in the hypothesis that specific imaging biomarkers, detectable through these advanced techniques, are intimately linked with AD's pathophysiology. Moreover, a multi-modal imaging approach will provide a more comprehensive understanding of AD, potentially leading to earlier diagnosis and improved therapeutic strategies.

  \section{Understanding Alzheimer's Disease}
  \label{sec:alzheimers-disease}

  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques in the brain \citep{petersen_alzheimers_2009}. The neuropathology of AD involves the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles, leading to neuronal death and brain atrophy \citep{petersen_alzheimers_2009}. Clinically, AD manifests as progressive cognitive decline, memory loss, and impairment in daily functioning. The current diagnostic criteria for AD have evolved over time, with a focus on integrating biomarkers such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta levels and neuroimaging findings into the diagnostic process.

  The neuropathological changes in AD, including the accumulation of beta-amyloid and tau proteins, are closely related to the clinical manifestations of the disease, such as memory loss and cognitive decline \citep{jack_serial_2009}. The presence of brain amyloidosis alone is not sufficient to produce cognitive decline; rather, the neurodegenerative component of AD pathology directly correlates with cognitive impairment \citep{jack_serial_2009}. Furthermore, the rate of cognitive decline in AD is driven by the rate of neurodegeneration, highlighting the importance of understanding the structural and functional changes in the brain \citep{jack_serial_2009}.

  In summary, the cardinal features of AD encompass its neuropathology, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic criteria. Understanding these features is crucial for designing neuroimaging studies to investigate the structural and functional changes associated with AD. The next chapter will focus on the objectives of the proposed study, the specific hypotheses being tested, and the rationale for the choice of biomarkers and neuroimaging techniques.

  \section{Objectives and Hypotheses of the Study}
  \label{sec:objectives-and-hypotheses}

  The primary objective of the study is to investigate the structural and functional changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) using neuroimaging techniques. Specifically, the study aims to identify biomarkers that can provide insights into the neuropathological progression of AD and its clinical manifestations. The hypotheses being tested revolve around the association between specific neuroimaging biomarkers and the underlying pathophysiology of AD.

  To achieve these objectives, the study will focus on the selection of appropriate structural and functional biomarkers for each neuroimaging technique. The rationale for the choice of biomarkers lies in their potential to capture the key neuropathological changes characteristic of AD. For instance, the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles in the brain, which are hallmarks of AD neuropathology, can be visualised using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with radiotracers specific to amyloid and tau proteins \citep{bao_pet_2021}. Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide structural biomarkers such as hippocampal volume loss, which is associated with AD-related neurodegeneration \citep{besson_cognitive_2015}.

  Furthermore, the study will explore the potential of multi-modal neuroimaging techniques, integrating data from different imaging modalities to provide a comprehensive understanding of AD pathology. Recent advancements in deep learning approaches have shown promise in combining neuroimaging and genomics data to enhance the diagnosis and prediction of AD \citep{lin_deep_2021}. By leveraging multi-modal neuroimaging, the study aims to uncover synergistic biomarkers that can offer a more comprehensive view of AD pathology.

  The choice of biomarkers and neuroimaging techniques is underpinned by a growing body of evidence that supports their relevance in capturing the complex neuropathological changes in AD. For instance, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has been instrumental in identifying and validating neuroimaging biomarkers, such as hippocampal volume loss and amyloid deposition, as indicators of preclinical AD \citep{saykin_genetic_2015}. Additionally, the integration of genetic data from ADNI has contributed to a deeper understanding of AD pathophysiology \citep{saykin_genetic_2015}.

  In summary, the study aims to leverage advanced neuroimaging techniques to identify structural and functional biomarkers associated with AD neuropathology. The hypotheses being tested revolve around the association between these biomarkers and the underlying pathophysiology of AD, with a focus on multi-modal neuroimaging approaches to provide a comprehensive understanding of the disease.

  \section{Neuroimaging Methods for the Study}
  \label{sec:neuroimaging-methods}

  The selection of neuroimaging methods for the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for capturing the structural and functional changes associated with the disease. The study will focus on identifying and describing the neuroimaging methods best suited for investigating the chosen structural and functional biomarkers, considering the specific research questions and objectives.

  One of the primary neuroimaging methods to be considered is positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with radiotracers specific to amyloid and tau proteins. PET imaging allows for the visualisation and quantification of beta-amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles, which are key neuropathological hallmarks of AD \citep{jack_serial_2009}. This method provides valuable insights into the distribution and accumulation of these proteins in the brain, offering a direct assessment of AD pathology.

  In addition to PET imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in capturing structural biomarkers associated with AD. MRI can provide detailed anatomical information, including measures of brain volume, cortical thickness, and hippocampal atrophy, which are indicative of neurodegenerative changes in AD \citep{cai_magnetic_2020}. Furthermore, recent advancements in MRI texture analysis have shown promise in identifying subtle microstructural alterations in the brain associated with AD pathology \citep{cai_magnetic_2020}.

  Moreover, the study will explore the potential of multi-modal neuroimaging techniques, which integrate data from different imaging modalities to provide a comprehensive understanding of AD pathology. Multi-modal approaches, such as combining PET and MRI data, can offer synergistic insights into the structural and functional changes in AD, enhancing the sensitivity and specificity of biomarker detection \citep{ran_multimodal_2022}. These methods enable the comprehensive assessment of AD-related neuropathological changes, providing a more holistic view of the disease process.

  While PET and MRI are valuable neuroimaging methods, it is essential to consider the strengths and limitations of each technique in relation to the features of the psychiatric condition studied. PET imaging, for instance, offers high sensitivity and specificity in detecting amyloid and tau pathology, but it involves exposure to ionising radiation and may have limited availability in certain clinical settings \citep{bao_pet_2021}. On the other hand, MRI provides excellent spatial resolution and does not involve radiation exposure, making it suitable for longitudinal studies and clinical applications \citep{cai_magnetic_2020}. However, MRI may have limitations in detecting specific molecular pathology compared to PET imaging.

  In summary, the selection of neuroimaging methods for the study of AD is critical for capturing the structural and functional changes associated with the disease. PET and MRI, along with multi-modal approaches, offer valuable insights into AD pathology, and understanding their strengths and limitations is essential for designing a comprehensive and effective neuroimaging study.

  \section{Justification of Study Design}
  \label{sec:justification-of-study-design}

  The study design for investigating structural and functional changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) using neuroimaging techniques requires a robust justification based on classical and recent published work. This chapter aims to critically evaluate potential sources of bias and confounding, discuss the key variables that need to be controlled for, and explain how the risk of bias and confounding will be minimised.

  Classical and recent published work have highlighted the importance of controlling for key variables in neuroimaging studies of AD. For instance, the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of AD has been a subject of ongoing research, emphasising the need to account for potential misdiagnosis or variability in clinical phenotypes . Additionally, the evolution of diagnostic criteria for AD has implications for study design, as changes in criteria may impact the interpretation of neuroimaging findings .

  Potential sources of bias and confounding in neuroimaging studies of AD include the influence of comorbid conditions, medication effects, and demographic factors on imaging biomarkers. For example, the presence of cerebrovascular disease in AD cases can confound neuroimaging findings, necessitating careful consideration and control of vascular risk factors in the study design . Moreover, the impact of genetic variability, such as HLA alleles, on neuroimaging biomarkers should be addressed to minimise potential bias .

  To minimise the risk of bias and confounding, the study design will incorporate rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria to control for comorbid conditions and medication effects. Additionally, the use of advanced statistical methods, such as propensity score matching, will enable the adjustment for demographic and clinical variables that may confound neuroimaging findings . Furthermore, the inclusion of a well-characterised control group matched for relevant variables will enhance the internal validity of the study.

  The limitations of the neuroimaging techniques used in the study design must also be addressed. For instance, the potential for measurement error and variability in imaging protocols may introduce bias and confounding, necessitating standardised acquisition and processing methods across study sites . Moreover, the interpretation of neuroimaging findings in the context of AD neuropathology requires careful consideration of the dynamic nature of the disease process and the potential for atypical presentations .

  In summary, the study design will address potential sources of bias and confounding by controlling for key variables, minimising measurement error, and considering the limitations of neuroimaging techniques. By integrating classical and recent published work, the study will adopt a comprehensive approach to ensure the validity and reliability of the findings related to structural and functional changes in AD.
