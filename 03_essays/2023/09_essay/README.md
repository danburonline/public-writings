## Essay Task

Imagine you are part of a team of scientists at a leading institution that investigates structural and functional biomarkers. Your next project is to design a controlled experiment where two different neuroimaging techniques are used to investigate structural and functional changes in one psychiatric condition of your choice (choose one among Alzheimer's disease, Major Depressive Disorder or Schizophrenia), and critically evaluate the suitability of your experimental design. In your essay, you should: a) Briefly describe the cardinal features of the chosen psychiatric condition to be studied, including its neuropathology, clinical manifestations, and current diagnostic criteria. b) State the objective(s) of your study, the specific hypotheses being tested, and the chosen structural or functional biomarker(s) for each neuroimaging technique. Provide a detailed rationale for your choice of biomarkers and explain how they relate to the pathophysiology of the psychiatric condition studied. c) Identify and describe the neuroimaging methods best suited for your study, based on the specific research questions and biomarkers being investigated. Discuss the strengths and limitations of each technique in relation to the features of the psychiatric condition studied. d) Justify your study design using both classical and recent published work, and critically evaluate potential sources of bias and confounding. Discuss the key variables that need to be controlled for and explain how you plan to minimize the risk of bias and confounding. In other words, you should address any limitations your study design might have and in particular limitations of the neuroimaging techniques used.

Your essay should demonstrate a clear understanding of the selected neuroimaging techniques and their applications in the context of the psychiatric condition studied, as well as a critical evaluation of the literature and an ability to synthesize complex information from multiple sources.
