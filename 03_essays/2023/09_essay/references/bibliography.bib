Here, we leverage the normative human brain connectome to test whether seemingly heterogeneous neuroimaging findings localize to connected brain networks. We use neurodegenerative disease, and specifically Alzheimer's disease, as our example as it is one of the diseases that has been studied the most using neuroimaging. First, we show that neuroimaging findings in Alzheimer's disease occur in different brain regions across different studies but localize to the same functionally connected brain network. Second, we show that neuroimaging findings across different neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, corticobasal syndrome, and progressive non-fluent aphasia) localize to different diseasespecific brain networks. Finally, we show that neuroimaging findings for a specific symptom within a disease (delusions in Alzheimer's disease) localize to a symptom-specific brain network. Our results suggest that neuroimaging studies that appear poorly reproducible may identify different regions within the same connected brain network. Human connectome data can be used to link heterogeneous neuroimaging findings to common neuroanatomy, improving localization of neuropsychiatric diseases and symptoms.},

The goal of this study was to evaluate the prognostic ability of genetic, {CSF}, neuroimaging, and cognitive measurements obtained in the same participants.Methods: {APOE} ⑀4 allele frequency, {CSF} proteins (A␤ 1-42 , total tau, hyperphosphorylated tau [p-tau 181p ]), glucose metabolism ({FDG}-{PET}), hippocampal volume, and episodic memory performance were evaluated at baseline in patients with amnestic {MCI} (n ϭ 85), using data from a large multisite study (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative). Patients were classified as normal or abnormal on each predictor variable based on externally derived cutoffs, and then variables were evaluated as predictors of subsequent conversion to Alzheimer disease ({AD}) and cognitive decline (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale) during a variable follow-up period (1.9 Ϯ 0.4 years). Results:Patients with {MCI} converted to {AD} at an annual rate of 17.2\%. Subjects with {MCI} who had abnormal results on both {FDG}-{PET} and episodic memory were 11.7 times more likely to convert to {AD} than subjects who had normal results on both measures (p Յ 0.02). In addition, the {CSF} ratio p-tau 181p /A␤ 1-42 (␤ ϭ 1.10 Ϯ 0.53; p ϭ 0.04) and, marginally, {FDG}-{PET} predicted cognitive decline. Conclusions:Baseline {FDG}-{PET} and episodic memory predict conversion to {AD}, whereas p-tau 181p /A␤ 1-42 and, marginally, {FDG}-{PET} predict longitudinal cognitive decline. Complementary information provided by these biomarkers may aid in future selection of patients for clinical trials or identification of patients likely to benefit from a therapeutic intervention. Neurology Individuals with mild cognitive impairment ({MCI}) are a target population for evaluating very early treatment interventions for Alzheimer disease ({AD}) since they represent an intermediate stage between normal function and {AD}, and are at higher risk for decline than healthy older individuals. Because individuals with {MCI} decline at different rates and some never develop {AD}, there is a need for tools to select patients with {MCI} who would benefit most from treatment.

Sparse canonical correlation analysis ({SCCA}) models are well-known tools for identifying meaningful biomarkers in imaging genetics. However, most {SCCA} models incorporate only diagnostic status information, which poses challenges for finding disease-specific biomarkers. In this study, we proposed a multi-task sparse canonical correlation analysis and regression ({MT}-{SCCAR}) model to reveal disease-specific associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and quantitative traits derived from multi-modal neuroimaging data in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ({ADNI}) cohort. {MT}-{SCCAR} uses complementary information carried by multiple-perspective cognitive scores and encourages group sparsity on genetic variants. In contrast with two other multi-modal {SCCA} models, {MT}-{SCCAR} embedded more accurate neuropsychological assessment information through linear regression and enhanced the correlation coefficients, leading to increased identification of high-risk brain regions. Furthermore, {MT}-{SCCAR} identified primary genetic risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}), including rs429358, and found some association patterns between genetic variants and brain regions. Thus, {MT}-{SCCAR} contributes to deciphering genetic risk factors of brain structural and metabolic changes by identifying potential risk biomarkers.},

Multimodality neuroimaging data such as {MRI} and {PET} provide valuable insights to abnormalities, and genetic data such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ({SNP}) provide information about a patient’s {AD} risk factors. When used in conjunction, {AD} diagnosis may be improved. However, these data are heterogeneous (e.g., having different data distributions), and have different number of samples (e.g., {PET} data is having far less number of samples than the numbers of {MRI} or {SNPs}). Thus, learning an effective model using these data is challenging. To this end, we present a novel three-stage deep feature learning and fusion framework, where the deep neural network is trained stage-wise. Each stage of the network learns feature representations for different combination of modalities, via effective training using maximum number of available samples. Specifically, in the first stage, we learn latent representations (i.e., high-level features) for each modality independently, so that the heterogeneity between modalities can be better addressed and then combined in the next stage. In the second stage, we learn the joint latent features for each pair of modality combination by using the high-level features learned from the first stage. In the third stage, we learn the diagnostic labels by fusing the learned joint latent features from the second stage. We have tested our framework on Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ({ADNI}) dataset for multi-status {AD} diagnosis, and the experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms other methods.},

  abstract  = {Generation of amyloid peptide (Aβ) is at the beginning of a cascade that leads to Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}). Amyloid precursor protein ({APP}), as well as β- and γ-secretases, is the principal player involved in Aβ production, while α-secretase cleavage on {APP} prevents Aβ deposition. Recent studies suggested that soluble assembly states of Aβ peptides can cause cognitive problems by disrupting synaptic function in the absence of significant neurodegeneration. Therefore, current research investigates the relative importance of these various soluble Aβ assemblies in causing synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits. Several Aβ oligomers targets and cellular mechanisms responsible of Aβ-induced synaptic failure have been identified. The first and most important mechanism impugns a toxic gain of function for Aβ which results due to self-association and attainment of new structures capable of novel interactions that lead to impaired plasticity. Other scenarios predicate that Aβ has a normal physiological role. On the one hand, insufficient Aβ could lead to a loss of normal function, whereas excess Aβ may precipitate dysfunction. How this occurs and which the main target/s is/are for the synaptic action of Aβ remains to be fully understood and would certainly represent one of the main challenges to future {AD} research.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, which is clinically associated with a global cognitive decline and progressive loss of memory and reasoning. According to the prevailing amyloid cascade hypothesis of {AD}, increased soluble amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomer levels impair the synaptic functions and augment calcium dyshomeostasis, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress as well as the formation of neurofibrillary tangles at specific brain regions. Emerging new findings related to synaptic dysfunction and initial steps of neuroinflammation in {AD} have been able to delineate the underlying molecular mechanisms, thus reinforcing the development of new treatment strategies and biomarkers for {AD} beyond the conventional Aβ- and tau-targeted approaches. Particularly, the identification and further characterization of disease-associated microglia and their {RNA} signatures, {AD}-associated novel risk genes, neurotoxic astrocytes, and in the involvement of complement-dependent pathway in synaptic pruning and loss in {AD} have set the outstanding basis for further preclinical and clinical studies. Here, we discuss the recent development and the key findings related to the novel molecular mechanisms and targets underlying the synaptotoxicity and neuroinflammation in {AD}.},

  abstract     = {Neuroinflammation play an important role in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. Advances in molecular imaging using positron emission tomography have provided insights into the time course of neuroinflammation and its relation with Alzheimer’s disease central pathologies in patients and in animal disease models. Recent single-cell sequencing and transcriptomics indicate dynamic disease-associated microglia and astrocyte profiles in Alzheimer’s disease. Mitochondrial 18-{kDa} translocator protein is the most widely investigated target for neuroinflammation imaging. New generation of translocator protein tracers with improved performance have been developed and evaluated along with tau and amyloid imaging for assessing the disease progression in Alzheimer’s disease continuum. Given that translocator protein is not exclusively expressed in glia, alternative targets are under rapid development, such as monoamine oxidase B, matrix metalloproteinases, colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, imidazoline-2 binding sites, cyclooxygenase, cannabinoid-2 receptor, purinergic P2X7 receptor, P2Y12 receptor, the fractalkine receptor, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2, and receptor for advanced glycation end products. Promising targets should demonstrate a higher specificity for cellular locations with exclusive expression in microglia or astrocyte and activation status (pro- or anti-inflammatory) with highly specific ligand to enable in vivo brain imaging. In this review, we summarised recent advances in the development of neuroinflammation imaging tracers and provided an outlook for promising targets in the future.},

  abstract     = {The synapse has consistently been considered a vulnerable and critical target within Alzheimer’s disease, and synapse loss is, to date, one of the main biological correlates of cognitive decline within Alzheimer’s disease. This occurs prior to neuronal loss with ample evidence that synaptic dysfunction precedes this, in support of the idea that synaptic failure is a crucial stage within disease pathogenesis. The two main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, abnormal aggregates of amyloid or tau proteins, have had demonstrable effects on synaptic physiology in animal and cellular models of Alzheimer’s disease. There is also growing evidence that these two proteins may have a synergistic effect on neurophysiological dysfunction. Here, we review some of the main findings of synaptic alterations in Alzheimer’s disease, and what we know from Alzheimer’s disease animal and cellular models. First, we briefly summarize some of the human evidence to suggest that synapses are altered, including how this relates to network activity. Subsequently, animal and cellular models of Alzheimer’s disease are considered, highlighting mouse models of amyloid and tau pathology and the role these proteins may play in synaptic dysfunction, either in isolation or examining how the two pathologies may interact in dysfunction. This specifically focuses on neurophysiological function and dysfunction observed within these animal models, typically measured using electrophysiology or calcium imaging. Following synaptic dysfunction and loss, it would be impossible to imagine that this would not alter oscillatory activity within the brain. Therefore, this review also discusses how this may underpin some of the aberrant oscillatory patterns seen in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease and human patients. Finally, an overview of some key directions and considerations in the field of synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease is covered. This includes current therapeutics that are targeted specifically at synaptic dysfunction, but also methods that modulate activity to rescue aberrant oscillatory patterns. Other important future avenues of note in this field include the role of non-neuronal cell types such as astrocytes and microglia, and mechanisms of dysfunction independent of amyloid and tau in Alzheimer’s disease. The synapse will certainly continue to be an important target within Alzheimer’s disease for the foreseeable future.},

Neurons carry out essential functions such as signal transmission and network integration in the central nervous system and are the main targets of neurodegenerative disease. In this Review, I address how the neuron’s environment also contributes to neurodegeneration. Maintaining an optimal milieu for neuronal function rests with supportive cells termed glia and the blood-brain barrier. Accumulating evidence suggests that neurodegeneration occurs in part because the environment is affected during disease in a cascade of processes collectively termed neuroinflammation. These observations indicate that therapies targeting glial cells might provide benefit for those afflicted by neurodegenerative disorders.},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer’s disease remains incurable, and the failures of current disease-modifying strategies for Alzheimer’s disease could be attributed to a lack of in vivo models that recapitulate the underlying etiology of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. The etiology of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease is not based on mutations related to amyloid-β (Aβ) or tau production which are currently the basis of in vivo models of Alzheimer’s disease. It has recently been suggested that mechanisms like chronic neuroinflammation may occur prior to amyloid-β and tau pathologies in late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. The aim of this study is to analyze the characteristics of rodent models of neuroinflammation in late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Our search criteria were based on characteristics of an idealistic disease model that should recapitulate causes, symptoms, and lesions in a chronological order similar to the actual disease. Therefore, a model based on the inflammation hypothesis of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease should include the following features: (i) primary chronic neuroinflammation, (ii) manifestations of memory and cognitive impairment, and (iii) late development of tau and Aβ pathologies. The following models fit the pre-defined criteria: lipopolysaccharide- and {PolyI}:C-induced models of immune challenge; streptozotocin-, okadaic acid-, and colchicine neurotoxin-induced neuroinflammation models, as well as interleukin-1β, anti-nerve growth factor and p25 transgenic models. Among these models, streptozotocin, {PolyI}:C-induced, and p25 neuroinflammation models are compatible with the inflammation hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease.},

Although definitive diagnosis of {AD} is often made in the presence of clinical manifestations in late stages, it is now universally believed that {AD} is a continuum of disease commencing from the preclinical stage with typical neuropathological alterations appearing decades prior to its first symptom, to the prodromal stage with slight symptoms of amnesia (amnestic mild cognitive impairment, {aMCI}), and then to the terminal stage with extensive loss of basic cognitive functions, i.e., {AD}-dementia. Positron emission tomography ({PET}) radiotracers have been developed in a search to meet the increasing clinical need of early detection and treatment monitoring for {AD}, with reference to the pathophysiological targets in Alzheimer's brain. These include the pathological aggregations of misfolded proteins such as β-amyloid (Aβ) plagues and neurofibrillary tangles ({NFTs}), impaired neurotransmitter system, neuroinflammation, as well as deficient synaptic vesicles and glucose utilization. In this article we survey the various {PET} radiotracers available for {AD} imaging and discuss their clinical applications especially in terms of early detection and cognitive relevance.},

We measured change in amyloid deposition over time using serial 11C Pittsburgh compound B ({PIB}) positron emission tomography and progression of neurodegeneration using serial structural magnetic resonance imaging. We studied 21 healthy cognitively normal subjects, 32 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 8 with Alzheimer's disease. Subjects were drawn from two sources—ongoing longitudinal registries at Mayo Clinic, and the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative ({ADNI}). All subjects underwent clinical assessments, {MRI} and {PIB} studies at two time points, approximately one year apart. {PIB} retention was quantified in global cortical to cerebellar ratio units and brain atrophy in units of cm3 by measuring ventricular expansion. The annual change in global {PIB} retention did not differ by clinical group (P = 0.90), and although small (median 0.042 ratio units/year overall) was greater than zero among all subjects (P \&lt; 0.001). Ventricular expansion rates differed by clinical group (P \&lt; 0.001) and increased in the following order: cognitively normal (1.3 cm3/year) \&lt;  amnestic mild cognitive impairment (2.5 cm3/year) \&lt;  Alzheimer's disease (7.7 cm3/year). Among all subjects there was no correlation between {PIB} change and concurrent change on {CDR}-{SB} (r = −0.01, P = 0.97) but some evidence of a weak correlation with {MMSE} (r =−0.22, P = 0.09). In contrast, greater rates of ventricular expansion were clearly correlated with worsening concurrent change on {CDR}-{SB} (r = 0.42, P \&lt; 0.01) and {MMSE} (r =−0.52, P \&lt; 0.01). Our data are consistent with a model of typical late onset Alzheimer's disease that has two main features: (i) dissociation between the rate of amyloid deposition and the rate of neurodegeneration late in life, with amyloid deposition proceeding at a constant slow rate while neurodegeneration accelerates and (ii) clinical symptoms are coupled to neurodegeneration not amyloid deposition. Significant plaque deposition occurs prior to clinical decline. The presence of brain amyloidosis alone is not sufficient to produce cognitive decline, rather, the neurodegenerative component of Alzheimer's disease pathology is the direct substrate of cognitive impairment and the rate of cognitive decline is driven by the rate of neurodegeneration. Neurodegeneration (atrophy on {MRI}) both precedes and parallels cognitive decline. This model implies a complimentary role for {MRI} and {PIB} imaging in Alzheimer's disease, with each reflecting one of the major pathologies, amyloid dysmetabolism and neurodegeneration.},

With the development of artificial intelligence, neuroimaging analysis using intelligent algorithms can capture more image feature patterns than artificial experience-based diagnosis. However, using only single neuroimaging techniques, e.g., magnetic resonance imaging, may omit some significant patterns that may have high relevance to the clinical target. Therefore, so far, combining different types of neuroimaging techniques that provide multimodal data for joint diagnosis has received extensive attention and research in the area of personalized medicine. In this study, based on the regularized label relaxation linear regression model, we propose a multikernel version for multimodal data fusion. The proposed method inherits the merits of the regularized label relaxation linear regression model and also has its own superiority. It can explore complementary patterns across different modal data and pay more attention to the modal data that have more significant patterns. In the experimental study, the proposed method is evaluated in the scenario of Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis. The promising performance indicates that the performance of multimodality fusion via multikernel learning is better than that of single modality. Moreover, the decreased square difference between training and testing performance indicates that overfitting is reduced and hence the generalization ability is improved.},

Here, we provide an update on sample collection, scientific progress and opportunities, conceptual issues, and future plans.
                  {METHODS}: Lymphoblastoid cell lines and {DNA} and {RNA} samples from blood have been collected and banked, and data and biosamples have been widely disseminated. To date, {APOE} genotyping, genome-wide association study ({GWAS}), and whole exome and whole genome sequencing data have been obtained and disseminated.
                  {RESULTS}: {ADNI} genetic data have been downloaded thousands of times, and {\textgreater}300 publications have resulted, including reports of large-scale {GWAS} by consortia to which {ADNI} contributed. Many of the first applications of quantitative endophenotype association studies used {ADNI} data, including some of the earliest {GWAS} and pathway-based studies of biospecimen and imaging biomarkers, as well as memory and other clinical/cognitive variables. Other contributions include some of the first whole exome and whole genome sequencing data sets and reports in healthy controls, mild cognitive impairment, and {AD}.
                  {DISCUSSION}: Numerous genetic susceptibility and protective markers for {AD} and disease biomarkers have been identified and replicated using {ADNI} data and have heavily implicated immune, mitochondrial, cell cycle/fate, and other biological processes. Early sequencing studies suggest that rare and structural variants are likely to account for significant additional phenotypic variation. Longitudinal analyses of transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and epigenomic changes will also further elucidate dynamic processes underlying preclinical and prodromal stages of disease. Integration of this unique collection of multiomics data within a systems biology framework will help to separate truly informative markers of early disease mechanisms and potential novel therapeutic targets from the vast background of less relevant biological processes. Fortunately, a broad swath of the scientific community has accepted this grand challenge.},

Our aim was to characterize the cognitive and brain profiles of elders classified as positive or negative for each biomarker to further our understanding of their use in the preclinical diagnosis of {AD}. Fifty-four cognitively normal individuals (age = 65.8 ± 8.3 years) underwent neuropsychological tests (structural {MRI}, {FDG}-{PET}, and Florbetapir-{PET}) and were dichotomized into positive or negative independently for each neuroimaging biomarker. Demographic, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging data were compared between positive and negative subgroups. The {MRI}-positive subgroup had lower executive performances and mixed patterns of lower volume and metabolism in {AD}-characteristic regions and in the prefrontal cortex. The {FDG}-positive subgroup showed only hypometabolism, predominantly in {AD}-sensitive areas extending to the whole neocortex, compared with the {FDG}-negative subgroup. The amyloid-positive subgroup was older and included more {APOE} ε4 carriers compared with the amyloid-negative subgroup. When considering {MRI} and/or {FDG} biomarkers together (i.e., the neurodegeneration-positive), there was a trend for an inverse relationship with Aβ deposition such that those with neurodegeneration tended to show less Aβ deposition and the reverse was true as well. Our findings suggest that: (1) {MRI} and {FDG} biomarkers provide complementary rather than redundant information and (2) relatively young cognitively normal elders tend to have either neurodegeneration or Aβ deposition, but not both, suggesting additive rather than sequential/causative links between {AD} neuroimaging biomarkers at this age. Significance statement: Neuroimaging biomarkers are included in the recent research criteria for preclinical Alzheimer's disease ({AD}). However, how to use these biomarkers is still being debated, especially regarding their sequence. Our findings suggest that {MRI} and {FDG}-{PET} biomarkers should be used in combination, offering an additive contribution instead of reflecting the same process of neurodegeneration. Moreover, the present study also challenges the hierarchical use of the neuroimaging biomarkers in preclinical {AD} because it suggests that the neurodegeneration observed in this population is not due to β-amyloid deposition. Rather, our results suggest that β-amyloid- and tau-related pathological processes may interact but not necessarily appear in a systematic sequence.},
