Here, we leverage the normative human brain connectome to test whether seemingly heterogeneous neuroimaging findings localize to connected brain networks. We use neurodegenerative disease, and specifically Alzheimer's disease, as our example as it is one of the diseases that has been studied the most using neuroimaging. First, we show that neuroimaging findings in Alzheimer's disease occur in different brain regions across different studies but localize to the same functionally connected brain network. Second, we show that neuroimaging findings across different neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, corticobasal syndrome, and progressive non-fluent aphasia) localize to different diseasespecific brain networks. Finally, we show that neuroimaging findings for a specific symptom within a disease (delusions in Alzheimer's disease) localize to a symptom-specific brain network. Our results suggest that neuroimaging studies that appear poorly reproducible may identify different regions within the same connected brain network. Human connectome data can be used to link heterogeneous neuroimaging findings to common neuroanatomy, improving localization of neuropsychiatric diseases and symptoms.},

The goal of this study was to evaluate the prognostic ability of genetic, {CSF}, neuroimaging, and cognitive measurements obtained in the same participants.Methods: {APOE} ⑀4 allele frequency, {CSF} proteins (A␤ 1-42 , total tau, hyperphosphorylated tau [p-tau 181p ]), glucose metabolism ({FDG}-{PET}), hippocampal volume, and episodic memory performance were evaluated at baseline in patients with amnestic {MCI} (n ϭ 85), using data from a large multisite study (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative). Patients were classified as normal or abnormal on each predictor variable based on externally derived cutoffs, and then variables were evaluated as predictors of subsequent conversion to Alzheimer disease ({AD}) and cognitive decline (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale) during a variable follow-up period (1.9 Ϯ 0.4 years). Results:Patients with {MCI} converted to {AD} at an annual rate of 17.2\%. Subjects with {MCI} who had abnormal results on both {FDG}-{PET} and episodic memory were 11.7 times more likely to convert to {AD} than subjects who had normal results on both measures (p Յ 0.02). In addition, the {CSF} ratio p-tau 181p /A␤ 1-42 (␤ ϭ 1.10 Ϯ 0.53; p ϭ 0.04) and, marginally, {FDG}-{PET} predicted cognitive decline. Conclusions:Baseline {FDG}-{PET} and episodic memory predict conversion to {AD}, whereas p-tau 181p /A␤ 1-42 and, marginally, {FDG}-{PET} predict longitudinal cognitive decline. Complementary information provided by these biomarkers may aid in future selection of patients for clinical trials or identification of patients likely to benefit from a therapeutic intervention. Neurology Individuals with mild cognitive impairment ({MCI}) are a target population for evaluating very early treatment interventions for Alzheimer disease ({AD}) since they represent an intermediate stage between normal function and {AD}, and are at higher risk for decline than healthy older individuals. Because individuals with {MCI} decline at different rates and some never develop {AD}, there is a need for tools to select patients with {MCI} who would benefit most from treatment.

  abstract     = {Imaging genetics combines neuroimaging and genetics to assess the relationships between genetic variants and changes in brain structure and metabolism. Sparse canonical correlation analysis ({SCCA}) models are well-known tools for identifying meaningful biomarkers in imaging genetics. However, most {SCCA} models incorporate only diagnostic status information, which poses challenges for finding disease-specific biomarkers. In this study, we proposed a multi-task sparse canonical correlation analysis and regression ({MT}-{SCCAR}) model to reveal disease-specific associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and quantitative traits derived from multi-modal neuroimaging data in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ({ADNI}) cohort. {MT}-{SCCAR} uses complementary information carried by multiple-perspective cognitive scores and encourages group sparsity on genetic variants. In contrast with two other multi-modal {SCCA} models, {MT}-{SCCAR} embedded more accurate neuropsychological assessment information through linear regression and enhanced the correlation coefficients, leading to increased identification of high-risk brain regions. Furthermore, {MT}-{SCCAR} identified primary genetic risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}), including rs429358, and found some association patterns between genetic variants and brain regions. Thus, {MT}-{SCCAR} contributes to deciphering genetic risk factors of brain structural and metabolic changes by identifying potential risk biomarkers.},

Mining potential molecular markers of {AD} from high-dimensional, multi-modal neuroimaging and omics data will provide a new basis for early diagnosis and intervention in {AD}. In order to discover the real pathogenic mutation and even understand the pathogenic mechanism of {AD}, lots of machine learning methods have been designed and successfully applied to the analysis and processing of large-scale {AD} biomedical data.

The keywords of literature retrieval include Alzheimer's disease, bioinformatics, image genetics, genome-wide association research, molecular interaction network, multi-omics data integration, and so on. Conclusion: This study comprehensively introduces machine learning-based processing techniques for {AD} neuroimaging data and then shows the progress of computational analysis methods in omics data, such as the genome, proteome, and so on. Subsequently, machine learning methods for {AD} imaging analysis are also summarized.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we aim to maximally utilize multimodality neuroimaging and genetic data to predict Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) and its prodromal status, i.e., a multi-status dementia diagnosis problem. Multimodality neuroimaging data such as {MRI} and {PET} provide valuable insights to abnormalities, and genetic data such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ({SNP}) provide information about a patient’s {AD} risk factors. When used in conjunction, {AD} diagnosis may be improved. However, these data are heterogeneous (e.g., having different data distributions), and have different number of samples (e.g., {PET} data is having far less number of samples than the numbers of {MRI} or {SNPs}). Thus, learning an effective model using these data is challenging. To this end, we present a novel three-stage deep feature learning and fusion framework, where the deep neural network is trained stage-wise. Each stage of the network learns feature representations for different combination of modalities, via effective training using maximum number of available samples. Specifically, in the first stage, we learn latent representations (i.e., high-level features) for each modality independently, so that the heterogeneity between modalities can be better addressed and then combined in the next stage. In the second stage, we learn the joint latent features for each pair of modality combination by using the high-level features learned from the first stage. In the third stage, we learn the diagnostic labels by fusing the learned joint latent features from the second stage. We have tested our framework on Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ({ADNI}) dataset for multi-status {AD} diagnosis, and the experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms other methods.},
