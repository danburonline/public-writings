In addition, using classic and more recent studies in the field debate how optogenetics has been used to allow a greater understanding of neural pathways. Your essay should demonstrate a clear understanding of the selected mechanisms/techniques, as well as a critical evaluation of the relevant literature and an ability to synthesize complex information from multiple sources.
