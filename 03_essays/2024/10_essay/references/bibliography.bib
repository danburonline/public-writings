Long-term recurrent seizure attacks can cause serious damage to brain function, which is usually observed in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Controlling seizure attacks is vital for the treatment and prognosis of epilepsy. Animal models, such as the kindling model, which was the most widely used model in the past, allow the understanding of the potential epileptogenic mechanisms and selection of antiepileptic drugs. In recent years, various animal models of epilepsy have been established to mimic different seizure types, without clear merits and demerits.

  abstract = {Epilepsy surgery is aimed to remove the brain tissues that are indispensable for generating patient’s epileptic seizures. There are two purposes in the pre-operative evaluation: localization of the epileptogenic zone and localization of function. Surgery is planned to remove possible epileptogenic zone while preserving functional area. Since no single diagnostic modality is superior to others in identifying and localizing the epileptogenic zone, multiple non-invasive evaluations are performed to estimate the location of the epileptogenic zone after concordance between evaluations. Essential components of non-invasive pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsy include detailed clinical history, long-term video-electroencephalography monitoring, epilepsy-protocol magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and neuropsychological testing. However, a significant portion of drug-resistant epilepsy is associated with no or subtle MRI lesions or with ambiguous electro-clinical signs. Additional evaluations including fluoro-deoxy glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), magnetoencephalography and ictal single photon emission computed tomography can play critical roles in planning surgery. FDG-PET should be registered on three-dimensional MRI for better detection of focal cortical dysplasia. All diagnostic tools are complementary to each other in defining the epileptogenic zone, so that it is always important to reassess the data based on other results to pick up or confirm subtle abnormalities.},

Since epileptic seizures are spontaneous and some cases cannot be controlled, the approach to detect or even anticipate them is highly required. This paper shows the development of an algorithm based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN), in this case, a feedforward neural network with a training method of backpropagation, with the objective to detect an epileptic event. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) are applied to extract input parameters to train the neural network, which classify the electroencephalogram (EEG) recording in two output classes, normal and epileptic state. Then, the network classifies the EEG signal of 20 patients, regardless of seizure type, where the performance to detect epilepsy seizures was a 98.3\% accuracy, 93\% sensibility, and 96.1\% specificity, besides was achieved a 100\% accuracy and specificity in free seizure patients.},

These equations incorporate nonlinearities, axonal and dendritic lags, excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations, and the two-dimensional nature of the cortex, while rendering nonlinear features far more tractable than previous formulations, both analytically and numerically. The model equations are first used to calculate steady-state levels of cortical activity for various levels of stimulation. Dispersion equations for linear waves are then derived analytically and an analytic expression is found for the linear stability boundary beyond which a seizure will occur. The effects of boundary conditions in determining global eigenmodes are also studied in various geometries and the corresponding eigenfrequencies are found. Numerical results confirm the analytic ones, which are also found to reproduce existing results in the relevant limits, thereby elucidating the limits of validity of previous approximations.},

Comprehension of the complex mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis and seizure generation in temporal lobe epilepsy and other forms of epilepsy cannot be fully acquired in clinical studies with humans. As a result, the use of appropriate animal models is essential. Some of these models replicate the natural history of symptomatic focal epilepsy with an initial epileptogenic insult, which is followed by an apparent latent period and by a subsequent period of chronic spontaneous seizures. Seizures are a combination of electrical and behavioral events that are able to induce chemical, molecular, and anatomic alterations. In this review, we summarize the most frequently used models of chronic epilepsy and models of acute seizures induced by chemoconvulsants, traumatic brain injury, and electrical or sound stimuli. Genetic models of absence seizures and models of seizures and status epilepticus in the immature brain were also examined. Major uses and limitations were highlighted, and neuropathological, behavioral, and neurophysiological similarities and differences between the model and the human equivalent were considered. The quest for seizure mechanisms can provide insights into overall brain functions and consciousness, and animal models of epilepsy will continue to promote the progress of both epilepsy and neurophysiology research.Keywords: epilepsy, animal model, pilocarpine, kindling, neurodevelopment},

Here, we demonstrate induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic or adult fibroblasts by introducing four factors, Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4, under ES cell culture conditions. Unexpectedly, Nanog was dispensable. These cells, which we designated iPS (induced pluripotent stem) cells, exhibit the morphology and growth properties of ES cells and express ES cell marker genes. Subcutaneous transplantation of iPS cells into nude mice resulted in tumors containing a variety of tissues from all three germ layers. Following injection into blastocysts, iPS cells contributed to mouse embryonic development. These data demonstrate that pluripotent stem cells can be directly generated from fibroblast cultures by the addition of only a few defined factors.},

In this protocol we describe how to generate and assemble subdomain-specific forebrain spheroids, also known as brain-region specific organoids, from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). We describe how to pattern the neural spheroids towards either a dorsal forebrain or ventral forebrain fate, establishing human cortical spheroids (hCS) or, human subpallial spheroids (hSS), respectively. We also describe how to combine the neural spheroids in vitro to assemble forebrain assembloids that recapitulate the interactions of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons seen in vivo. Astrocytes are also present in the human forebrain-specific spheroids and these undergo maturation when the forebrain spheroids are cultured long-term. The initial generation of neural spheroids from hPSCs occurs in less than one week, with regional patterning occurring over the subsequent 5 weeks. After the initial maturation stage, brain region-specific spheroids are amenable to a variety of assays, including live cell imaging, calcium signaling, electrophysiology, cell purification, single cell transcriptomics, and immunohistochemistry. Once generated, forebrain spheroids can also be matured for over 24 months in culture.},

  abstract  = {The composition, elasticity, and organization of the extracellular matrix within the central nervous system contribute to the architecture and function of the brain. From an in vitro modeling perspective, soft biomaterials are needed to mimic the 3D neural microenvironments. While many studies have investigated 3D culture and neural network formation in bulk hydrogel systems, these approaches have limited ability to position cells to mimic sophisticated brain architectures. In this study, cortical neurons and astrocytes acutely isolated from the brains of rats are bioprinted in a hydrogel to form 3D neuronal constructs. Successful bioprinting of cellular and acellular strands in a multi-bioink approach allows the subsequent formation of gray- and white-matter tracts reminiscent of cortical structures. Immunohistochemistry shows the formation of dense, 3D axon networks. Calcium signaling and extracellular electrophysiology in these 3D neuronal networks confirm spontaneous activity in addition to evoked activities under pharmacological and electrical stimulation. The system and bioprinting approaches are capable of fabricating soft, free-standing neuronal structures of different bioink and cell types with high resolution and throughput, which provide a promising platform for understanding fundamental questions of neural networks, engineering neuromorphic circuits, and for in vitro drug screening.},

  abstract   = {Objective Many different gene families are currently being investigated for their potential role in epilepsy and in the response to antiepileptic drugs. A common research challenge is identifying the members of a gene family that are most significantly dysregulated within the human epileptic focus, before taking them forward for resource-intensive functional studies. Published data about transcriptomic changes within the human epileptic focus remains incomplete. A need exists for an accurate in silico system for the prediction of dysregulated genes within the epileptic focus. We present such a bioinformatic system. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by applying it to the solute carrier (SLC) gene family. There are {\textgreater}400 known SLCs. SLCs have never been systematically studied in epilepsy. Methods Using our in silico system, we predicted the SLCs likely to be dysregulated in the epileptic focus. We validated our in silico predictions by identifying ex vivo the SLCs dysregulated in epileptic foci, and determining the overlap between our in silico and ex vivo results. For the ex vivo analysis, we used a custom oligonucleotide microarray containing exon probes for all known SLCs to analyze 24 hippocampal samples obtained from surgery for pharmacoresistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and 24 hippocampal samples from normal postmortem controls. Results There was a highly significant (p {\textless} 9.99 × 10−7) overlap between the genes identified by our in silico and ex vivo strategies. The SLCs identified were either metal ion exchangers or neurotransmitter transporters, which are likely to play a part in epilepsy by influencing neuronal excitability. Significance The identified SLCs are most likely to mediate pharmacoresistance in epilepsy by enhancing the intrinsic severity of epilepsy, but further functional work will be needed to fully evaluate their role. Our successful in silico strategy can be adapted in order to prioritize genes relevant to epilepsy from other gene families.},
