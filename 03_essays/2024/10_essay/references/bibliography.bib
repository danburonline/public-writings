  abstract = {Epilepsy surgery is aimed to remove the brain tissues that are indispensable for generating patient’s epileptic seizures. There are two purposes in the pre-operative evaluation: localization of the epileptogenic zone and localization of function. Surgery is planned to remove possible epileptogenic zone while preserving functional area. Since no single diagnostic modality is superior to others in identifying and localizing the epileptogenic zone, multiple non-invasive evaluations are performed to estimate the location of the epileptogenic zone after concordance between evaluations. Essential components of non-invasive pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsy include detailed clinical history, long-term video-electroencephalography monitoring, epilepsy-protocol magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and neuropsychological testing. However, a significant portion of drug-resistant epilepsy is associated with no or subtle MRI lesions or with ambiguous electro-clinical signs. Additional evaluations including fluoro-deoxy glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), magnetoencephalography and ictal single photon emission computed tomography can play critical roles in planning surgery. FDG-PET should be registered on three-dimensional MRI for better detection of focal cortical dysplasia. All diagnostic tools are complementary to each other in defining the epileptogenic zone, so that it is always important to reassess the data based on other results to pick up or confirm subtle abnormalities.},

  abstract = {Epilepsy is a chronic neural disease that suffers around 50 million people in the world. Since epileptic seizures are spontaneous and some cases cannot be controlled, the approach to detect or even anticipate them is highly required. This paper shows the development of an algorithm based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN), in this case, a feedforward neural network with a training method of backpropagation, with the objective to detect an epileptic event. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) are applied to extract input parameters to train the neural network, which classify the electroencephalogram (EEG) recording in two output classes, normal and epileptic state. Then, the network classifies the EEG signal of 20 patients, regardless of seizure type, where the performance to detect epilepsy seizures was a 98.3\% accuracy, 93\% sensibility, and 96.1\% specificity, besides was achieved a 100\% accuracy and specificity in free seizure patients.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear equations are introduced to model the behavior of the waves of cortical electrical activity that are responsible for signals observed in electroencephalography. These equations incorporate nonlinearities, axonal and dendritic lags, excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations, and the two-dimensional nature of the cortex, while rendering nonlinear features far more tractable than previous formulations, both analytically and numerically. The model equations are first used to calculate steady-state levels of cortical activity for various levels of stimulation. Dispersion equations for linear waves are then derived analytically and an analytic expression is found for the linear stability boundary beyond which a seizure will occur. The effects of boundary conditions in determining global eigenmodes are also studied in various geometries and the corresponding eigenfrequencies are found. Numerical results confirm the analytic ones, which are also found to reproduce existing results in the relevant limits, thereby elucidating the limits of validity of previous approximations.},
